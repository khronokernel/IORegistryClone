# IORegistryClone

Rehosting the IORegistry application from Apple's [developer site](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/), specificlly the `Additional Tools for Xcode`.

Versions hosted here:

* [IORegistryExplorer v3.0.2](ioreg-302.zip)
  * Build 2136
  * Xcode 12
* [IORegistryExplorer v2.1.0](ioreg-210.zip)(
  * Build 575
  * Xcode 10


Note: v3.0.2 logs a lot more data(on average x2) that may be unnessary for most users(ie. HID info), if you're on limited bandwidth like discord I recommend using v2.1.0 instead.
