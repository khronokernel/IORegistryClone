# IORegistryClone

Rehosting the IORegistry application from Apple's [developer site](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/), specificlly the `Additional Tools for Xcode`.

Versions hosted here:

* [IORegistryExplorer v3.0.2](ioreg-302.zip) (Big Sur)
* [IORegistryExplorer v2.1.0](ioreg-210.zip) (Mavericks)


Note: v3.0.2 logs a lot more data that may be unnessary for most users, if you're on limited bandwidth like discord I recommend using v2.1.0 instead.
